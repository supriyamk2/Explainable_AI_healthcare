🔍 Highlights mentioned in the blog:

✅ Explainable AI (XAI): Methods and techniques that make ML models more understandable to humans.
✅ GradCAM: Generates visual explanations by highlighting important regions in images.
✅ GPT-4: Provides natural language explanations to further demystify model decisions.
✅ Gradio App: An interactive platform to make the interpretability process user-friendly.
